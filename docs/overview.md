# Marketplace Kubernetes Client Overview

The Marketplace Kubernetes Client is designed to simplify and streamline interactions with Kubernetes clusters for marketplace applications. It provides an abstraction layer over common Kubernetes operations, making it easier for developers and operators to manage deployments, services, and other resources without deep Kubernetes expertise.

## Goals

- Reduce complexity when working with Kubernetes in marketplace scenarios
- Provide a user-friendly API for resource management
- Automate repetitive tasks such as deployment, scaling, and cleanup
- Enable rapid development and integration of marketplace features
- Conserve the statadistics for get a better balance of resources with the angle of the present and past traffic data, creating a node for prevent errors of time to await and get the node with images ready for work.
- Predic cost for the new year with resources data for calculate the consumption.

## Architecture

The client acts as a bridge between marketplace logic and Kubernetes clusters. It handles authentication, configuration, and resource management, allowing users to focus on application logic rather than infrastructure details.

## Key Features

- Simplified deployment and service creation
- Automated resource scaling and cleanup
- Marketplace-specific utilities for app lifecycle management
- Support for multiple Kubernetes clusters

## Who Should Use This Client?

- DevOps teams managing marketplace workloads
- Anyone seeking a simpler way to interact with Kubernetes for marketplace solutions
